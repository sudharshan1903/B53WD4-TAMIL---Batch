HTTP1.1 => Hypertext Transfer Protocal 

* http is the first version .

* By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.

* before sending the request and the response there is a TCP connection between client & server.

* there is a open connection between client and server.

* several request and response are merege to single connections in Http1, There are the drawback in Http first version.


HTTP2 => it is next version of http (second version)

* its is binary framing layer that means textual content convert into binary format 

*  it is fully multipluxed that is one TCP(tranfer control protocal)  connection is used for multiple request.

* The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame. 




Difference between Http1 and Http2

         HTTP1                      

1. It works on the textual format.              

2. There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.

3. It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages

4. It compresses data by itself.

 
    HTTP2
1. It works on the binary protocol.

2. It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

3. It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 

4. It uses HPACK for data compression.
